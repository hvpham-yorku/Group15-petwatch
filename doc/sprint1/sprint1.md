The goal of the sprint is to:

1. Create a working login page for customers and pet sitters to where each can access their personal account data
2. Create a way for customers to add and update their pet(s) information on their account
3. Create a way for pet sitters to add a bio and general information to their account
4. Allow pet sitters to additionally include qualifications and contact information on their account

The user stories being used for the sprint, in order of priority, are:

1. As a user, I want to login so that I can access my personal data.
2. As a customer, I want to be able to add and update my pet(s) information, so that it is easily accessible.
3. As a pet sitter, I want to display my bio and general information, so that customers can see my availability and qualifications.
4. As a pet sitter, I want to include my qualifications and contact information, so that customers have the necessary information available.

The participants for this sprint are Arjon, Gjergj, Isha, Noah, and Sakshi. 
Arjon and Sakshi will be working on the frontend to complete our sprint goals, while Gjergj, Isha, and Noah will be working on the backend.

We decided on completing these user stories for sprint 1 as well felt that they provide a good foundation to build upon and are therefore a good starting point.
