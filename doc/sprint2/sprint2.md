The goal of the sprint is to:
 
1. Create a way for customers to view available pet sitters
2. Create a way for customers to make job postings with priorities
3. Create a way for pet sitters to view job postings
4. Create a way for pet sitters to accept or decline a job request.
5. Allow pet sitters to update their qualifications and contact information on their account

The user stories being used for the sprint, in order of priority, are:

1. As a customer, I want to post jobs on a notice board, so that I can reach a wider range if I have no specific preference for a sitter.
2. As a customer, I want to view available pet sitters, so that I can choose the best suited for my pet(s) according to my preference.
3. As a pet sitter, I want to be able to browse through job postings on the notice board, so that I can volunteer for jobs that fit my schedule.
4. As a pet sitter, I want to have the option to accept or decline a customer’s offer, so that I can handle personal commitments.
5. As a pet sitter, I want to include my qualifications and contact information, so that customers have the necessary information available.
6. As a pet sitter, I want to have access to the customer’s pet(s) information, so that I am aware of the job requirements.
7. As a customer, I want to be able to indicate priority for a job, so that any urgent or last-minute jobs have higher priority.
8. As a customer, I want to be able to leave reviews under pet sitters’ bio, so that I can let other users know about my experience.

The participants for this sprint are Arjon, Gjergj, Isha, Noah, and Sakshi. 
Arjon and Sakshi will continue working on the frontend to complete our sprint goals, while Gjergj, Isha, and Noah will be working on the backend.
Additionally, Isha and Noah will be working on documentation (on Github and Trello).

We decided on completing these user stories for sprint 2 as we felt that they will add relevant missing functionality to our project, and because they aligned with
what the TA suggested we add to our project for sprint 2.
