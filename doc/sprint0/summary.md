Project Objectives

The objective of the project is to create an application that allows users to find and hire local pet sitters through the app. Users will be able to post their pet(s)’ information, post jobs in need, indicate level of urgency, leave reviews on pet sitters whose services they have enrolled, and more. The application will also allow pet sitters to post and advertise their services. Pet sitters will be able to include a bio, availability, qualifications, accept job postings/service requests, and more. Both parties will be able to communicate with each other through the app once a pet sitter has accepted a job post or service request.

Key Users

The key users of the project would be pet owners in need of someone to take care of their pet, and pet sitters who want to provide to pet owners in need. A key persona for a pet owner in need would be George Philips, a family man and owner of two pets who is planning a family vacation and needs someone to look after the animals while the family is away. A key persona for a pet sitter looking to help pet owners in need and provide their services would be Alyssa Davis, a 24 year old veterinary student and pet owner who is looking to provide help to pet owners in need and make some money on the side while she studies. She already walks the dogs of some locals in the area and has taken care of her friends’ pets on multiple occasions, but is looking to expand her services to a wider audience.

Key Scenarios

Scenario 1: George Philips has a family trip planned for a week from now and needs someone to look after the two family pets, Scout the dog and Gilbert the cat. Originally, George had planned for his brother Marco to look after the pets, but something came up last minute and Marco was required to leave for a business trip. As a result, George turned to the internet and started looking for qualified and trustworthy local pet sitters, eventually landing on the PetWatch app. Using the app, he found he could easily make a post requesting the services of trusted local pet sitters on the app, or he could look for a pet sitter himself using the app.

Scenario  2: Alyssa Davis just got off for reading week and has extra time on her hands. She decides that she could use that time to get more experience with animals and make a little bit of money by taking care of animals in need. She already volunteers at the local animal shelter, but decides that she would also like to see if anyone in the area may be looking for someone to take care of their pets. Alyssa finds the PetWatch app and decides to check it out. She finds many local pet owners using the app in need of a pet sitter. Seeing this as a great opportunity, Alyssa creates an account and sets up a profile as a pet sitter. The app allows her to customize her profile and include a bio, general information, qualifications, availability, and contact information so that she can stand out. She responds to the job posts of a couple of pet owners, finding work and helping those in need.

Key Principles

Accessibility - The app should be user friendly and intuitive for users of all technological backgrounds

Safety - Users personal information should be protected, and pet sitters need to be approved by system admins prior to advertising their services and responding to pet owners in need

Usability - App should be convenient to use and provide users with a simple and enjoyable experience
