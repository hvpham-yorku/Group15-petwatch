## **How Pet Watch Differs**

Pet Watch offers several unique advantages and differentiating factors compared to existing solutions:

**Urgency Level Indicators**: Pet Watch allows pet owners to indicate the level of urgency for their pet sitting needs, helping prioritize time sensitive requests like George Philips' scenario with a last-minute cancellation.

**Job Posting System**: Unlike some competitors that only allow browsing sitters, Pet Watch enables pet owners to create specific job postings that sitters can respond to.

**Pet Information Profiles**: Pet Watch lets users post detailed information about their pets, ensuring sitters have all necessary care instructions.

**Admin-Approved Sitters**: Pet Watch prioritizes safety through system administrator approval of pet sitters before they can advertise services.

**In-app Communication**: Both parties can communicate directly through the app once a pet sitter has accepted a job post or service request.

## **Target Users & Scenarios**

Pet Watch specifically caters to:

**Pet Owners Seeking Care**: People like George Philips who need someone to look after their pets during planned absences or when original arrangements fall through.

**Aspiring Pet Care Providers**: People like Alyssa Davis \- students or part-time workers with animal care experience looking to expand their services and earn additional income.

### **Key Scenarios Where Pet Watch Excels**

**Planned Absences**: When pet owners like George are planning vacations and need reliable care for multiple pets.

**Last-Minute Changes**: When previously arranged pet care gets cancelled (like George's brother Marco becoming unavailable) and replacement care is needed.

**Service Provider Expansion**: Helping people like Alyssa Davis who have experience with animals expand their client base beyond friends and local connections.

## **Why Competitors Haven't Focused on These Areas**

**Flexibility vs. Structure Trade-off**: Competitors may focus more on browsing-based systems rather than job posting formats that Pet Watch employs.

**Safety Verification Process**: The admin approval system for sitters creates an additional safety layer but requires more operational resources than competitors may be willing to invest.

**User Interface Complexity**: Implementing urgency indicators and detailed pet profiles while maintaining app simplicity presents design challenges.

## **What It Would Take for Competitors to Address These Areas**

**Enhanced Safety Protocols**: Implementing an admin approval process similar to Pet Watch's would require additional personnel and verification systems.

**Feature Additions**: Adding urgency indicators and a job posting system would require significant platform updates.

**User Experience Redesign**: Balancing added features while maintaining accessibility for users of all technological backgrounds would require careful UX considerations.

       Pet Watch addresses these gaps by focusing on three key principles:

**Accessibility**: Creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface for users of all technological backgrounds

**Safety**: Protecting user information and requiring admin approval for pet sitters

**Usability**: Providing a convenient, simple, and enjoyable user experience

These factors enable Pet Watch to effectively serve both pet owners in urgent need of care and pet sitters looking to expand the service that they offer.
